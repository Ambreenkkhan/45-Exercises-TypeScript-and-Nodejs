// 18. Seeing the World: Think of at least five places in the world you’d like to visit.
// TASK:
// 1- Store the locations in a array. Make sure the array is not in alphabetical order.
import chalk from "chalk";
let places = [
    "Saudia Arabia",

// 2- Print your array in its original order.

// 3- Print array in alphabetical order without modifying the actual list.

// 4- Show that array is still in its original order by printing it.
console.log(chalk.green(`Array is still in its original order: ${places}.`));
// 5- Print array in reverse alphabetical order without changing the order of the original list.

// 6- Show that array is still in its original order by printing it again.

// 7- Reverse the order of your list. Print the array to show that its order has changed.

// 8- Reverse the order of your list again. Print the list to show it’s back to its original order.

// 9- Sort your array so it’s stored in alphabetical order. Print the array to show that its order has been changed.

// 10- Sort to change your array so it’s stored in reverse alphabetical order. Print the list to show that its order has changed.
