// 7.  Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations that each result in the number 8. Be sure to enclose your operations in print statements to see the results.

// 8. You should create four lines that look like this:
// console.log(5 + 3)

// Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8 appearing once on each line.

//Addition
console.log(4 + 4);
//Subtraction
console.log(15 - 7);
//Multiplication
console.log(4 * 2);
//Division
console.log(80 / 10);
